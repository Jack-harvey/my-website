        <p>It must be a real pain in the ass to make a seperate page like this for every 'post' you wanna make and then manually add it. I bet there's an elegant way to automate the creation of new pages with a pretty concrete layout with CSS. Chuck in some text, and an image upload and away you go. <br>
        I wonder if I can make a pretty way of organizing posts with an almost thumbnail that scrolls down and then you click it and it takes you to the new page. <br>
        The more I think of it the more it sounds like shit, you need to be able to make the website do that work. I sure as shit don't wanna do it. <br>
        Nah, I've got it. We're now writing a journal with posts sorted ascending :)
